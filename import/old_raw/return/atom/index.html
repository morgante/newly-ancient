Whether that thing is a job, life, or education, the middle just isn&#x2019;t that interesting. At the beginning, we are filled with excitement over the newness of the experience and anticipation for its possibilities. Bursting with enthusiasm, we are eager to share about our new experiences with anyone who will&amp;nbsp;listen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x2019;ve certainly seen this with &lt;a href="http://parallellifeabudhabi.blogspot.com/"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://jfsand.blogspot.com/"&gt;by&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://taleof3cities.tumblr.com/"&gt;students&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYU&lt;/span&gt;-Abu Dhabi&lt;/a&gt;. They post prolifically in the early days, but eventually their frequency deteriorates due to the inverse correlation between life and sharing. Still, as I contemplate attending college across halfway across the globe their posts help to make the prospect less&amp;nbsp;remote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I hope that by renewing my writing here and cataloguing the memories of my last &lt;del&gt;fifty&lt;/del&gt;forty-four days at &lt;a href="http://www.uwc-usa.org/default.aspx"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UWC&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I might be able to offer a similar resource to students (my zero-years!) contemplating this experience which I have lived and loved for the past two&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, writing here will also help me to reconcile that I have finally reached an ending. By reflecting on this amazing breakneck experience of the past two years, I hope to gain some insight into how exactly it has impacted me and where I see myself going from here. Hopefully, this might even help me to decide where to attend&amp;nbsp;university.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I thus promise to be an endblogger, posting regularly on the resolution of my life and investigating the future through pontifications on the&amp;nbsp;past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Also, please excuse the current state of the blog. I actually wrote this post several days ago, but got sidetracked with trying to restore the previous technically-advanced site. Failing that, I&#x2019;m shipping my writing with this &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product"&gt;minimum viable product&lt;/a&gt; until I find the time to make the blog beautiful&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry>
