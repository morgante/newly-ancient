Justifiably so. Though the outlines of these changes have been on the &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/11/twitter-ecosystem-guidelines/"&gt;horizon&lt;/a&gt; for a while, this new move clearly shows where Twitter is heading as a company and service. And I&amp;#8217;m not quite sure that&amp;#8217;s a direction I want to be&amp;nbsp;following.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;h3&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Company&lt;/h3&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;With this move, Twitter is making it clear that it means &lt;del&gt;business&lt;/del&gt;enterprise. Just the fact that the announcement is written in &lt;a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/08/what-twitters-api-announcement-could-have-said.html"&gt;MBAease&lt;/a&gt; clarifies that Twitter now thinks of itself more as a corporation than a startup. Indeed, its &lt;a href="http://unsuck-it.com/matrix/"&gt;infamous&lt;/a&gt; quadrant with &lt;em&gt;social &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="http://klout.com"&gt;social influence ranking&lt;/a&gt; makes it clear that the company is focused more on monetizing and consolidating than on continuing to innovate. Of course, we know how well that went for &lt;a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/08/twitter-bullshit/"&gt;other&amp;nbsp;companies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;h3&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Service&lt;/h3&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s nothing inherently wrong with attempting increased monetization except when it ends up being counter-productive. For Twitter, increased attempts at consolidation will quite possibly kill&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem for Twitter is that its service depends upon the very environment it&amp;#8217;s seeking to quash. Many of its best features, from &lt;a href="http://log.maniacalrage.net/post/26935842947/the-real-history-of-the-reply-on-twitter"&gt;@replies&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/04/30/the-short-and-illustrious-history-of-twitter-hashtags/"&gt;#hashtags&lt;/a&gt;, originally came from users. And it was the simple accessibility of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; which quickly made Twitter nearly ubiquitous&#x2014;&lt;a href="http://blog.ifttt.com/post/25506427600/thenewifttt"&gt;even your house can Tweet now&lt;/a&gt;. Without this robust ecosystem, Twitter is essentially just a text field&#x2014;something that any freshman &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; student could pull together in an afternoon.&lt;footnote&gt;Yes, I realize there&amp;#8217;s more complexity to it than that, mainly related to diseconomies of scale. Continue reading.&lt;/footnote&gt; Microsoft, for example, can afford to have MBAs run the company, because the switching costs are high. For Twitter, they&amp;#8217;re negligible. Anyone can build a text&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter&amp;#8217;s second major problem is one of direction: it&amp;#8217;s astronomically easier to go from closed to open than from open to closed. Apple can get away with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/236266262861324289"&gt;tight restrictions&lt;/a&gt; because before the App Store existed nobody felt entitled to install applications on their phone. Even in going from open to closed, Twitter could potentially succeed if that change provided a meaningful benefit to users. Facebook was more restricted than Myspace, but those restrictions came with the benefit of not having my eyeballs seared out from using it. Twitter is going in the opposite direction: it&amp;#8217;s restricting us to its main website which is, for your average alpha user, shittier than it was a few years&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Though these problems won&amp;#8217;t prompt an immediate exodus from Twitter (indeed, only &lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2012/07/23/only-an-estimated-23-of-tweets-are-posted-using-third-party-twitter-clients/"&gt;23% of posts&lt;/a&gt; come from external apps), Twitter should still be worried. It was that 23% which first left Myspace, Yahoo, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AOL&lt;/span&gt;. Particularly for a service as simple as Twitter&amp;#8217;s, they really matter&#x2014;what your tech-savvy friend is using has a greater impact than where Bieber is. Especially if we start to see a chilling effect where new developers don&amp;#8217;t include Twitter functionality in their apps due to the possibility of it being cut out of the&amp;nbsp;ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;h3&gt;Ownership&lt;/h3&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest objection to the changes is mostly philosophical. With the new &lt;a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-guidelines"&gt;display requirements&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter is asserting ownership over my content there. I agree with &lt;a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/08/16/twitter-api-changes"&gt;Marco&amp;#8217;s reading&lt;/a&gt;: rule 5b would seem to preclude me from quoting my own tweets on my own blog without their wrapper. This seems more like something an archaic &lt;a href="http://myfla.ws/blog/2008/06/16/burying-the-ap-a-grave-of-its-making/"&gt;wire service&lt;/a&gt; might try than the policy of a tech startup. Indeed, it make Twitter&amp;#8217;s viewpoint quite clear: our content and attention is their property to be sold to corporations for advertising and &amp;#8220;social &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; (whatever that&amp;nbsp;is).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;h3&gt;App.net&lt;/h3&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter&amp;#8217;s announcement came at the perfect time for &lt;a href="https://join.app.net/"&gt;app.net&lt;/a&gt;, which easily met its funding goal thanks to the general outcry in the web crowd. But I really don&amp;#8217;t think the way it&amp;#8217;s being portrayed matches either its potential or position. Despite what internet bloggers and campaign commercials say, there&amp;#8217;s nothing inherently virtuous about running an old-fashioned business where customers &lt;em&gt;pay you&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, app.net isn&amp;#8217;t even truly quixotic: it&amp;#8217;ll likely fail, but it was never&amp;nbsp;virtuous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the biggest reason it will fail is that for the vast majority of people, the $50 annual cost for the service far exceeds the utility it provides. Thus, the service will end up being the playground of the people &lt;a href="http://tessrinearson.com/blog/?p=516"&gt;with $50&lt;/a&gt; to spare for an empty text box. While Twitter might end up being &lt;a href="https://alpha.app.net/benbrooks/post/77250"&gt;filled&lt;/a&gt; with only &lt;q&gt;people following Bieber&lt;/q&gt; I likely follow a couple of Bieber-fans and wouldn&amp;#8217;t enjoy a platform without some of the &lt;em&gt;regular&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;My other major problem with app.net is that it isn&amp;#8217;t even doing what it purports to do. Instead of only charging users, it&amp;#8217;s charging &lt;a href="http://blog.intercom.io/surviving-thriving-in-two-sided-markets/"&gt;both sides of the market&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, members are being sold the &lt;q&gt;privilege&lt;/q&gt; of being sold to app developers for up to $1000. That might not seem like much for a legitimate business, but it&amp;#8217;s the sort of cost which is prohibitively expensive for quick projects and will seriously limit the ecosystem around app.net&#x2014;you won&amp;#8217;t see the ubiquitous support which Twitter currently&amp;nbsp;enjoys.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;h3&gt;My&amp;nbsp;Plans&lt;/h3&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know where things are headed, but I&amp;#8217;m guessing the future is neither Twitter or app.net. Until the future comes around, I&amp;#8217;m putting my time where my mouth is and spent the weekend building a Twitter &lt;a href="http://lab.morgante.net/microblog"&gt;clone&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://habariproject.org"&gt;Habari&lt;/a&gt;. The system I&amp;#8217;ve designed has a couple of&amp;nbsp;benefits:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;I control the content, through Habari, so Twitter certainly can&amp;#8217;t complain about me quoting their&amp;nbsp;material.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;For now, microposts are posted over to Twitter. Once the future comes, it&amp;#8217;ll be easy enough to post them there as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;For ease of mobile use, I can take advantage of the Twitter ecosystem by posting to a secret account which will be subsequently mirrored over here and on my main Twitter&amp;nbsp;account.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p class="note conclusion"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is likely a violation of Twitter&amp;#8217;s new requirements, so go ahead and &lt;a href="http://newlyancient.com/atom/micro"&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to my microposts over &lt;a href="http://newlyancient.com/micro"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;And get started on inventing the future&lt;/strong&gt;&#x2014;or just &lt;a href="https://github.com/habari-extras/microblog"&gt;fork mine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry>
