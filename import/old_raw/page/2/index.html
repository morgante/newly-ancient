</div>
<p>I love reading historical science fiction, as it can reveal the direction of aspirations and fears during a particular period. Of course, it&#8217;s also interesting to note when those stories of the future were set. This <a href="http://io9.com/5911520/a-chart-that-reveals-how-science-fiction-futures-changed-over-timew">analysis</a> reveals, for example, that in the 1980s the majority of science fiction concerned a near-future setting in the early 21st century. The change in obsession with the near-future is particularly intriguing to note, as it increases with the rise of Cold War tensions in the second half of the 20th century. This seems to make sense, as that time period contained a real possibility of a world being dramatically altered in the near future, possibly by nuclear war. In contrast, since the end of the Cold War, science fiction has turned more towards the far future, perhaps reflecting the long-term nature of current human concerns such as climate&nbsp;change.</p>	</div>

		<p>John Scalzi <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-there-is/">offers</a> an excellent explanation of privilege through the conceit of a video&nbsp;game:</p>
<blockquote>
Okay: In the role playing game known as The Real World, &#8220;Straight White Male&#8221; is the lowest difficulty setting there is.<br />You can lose playing on the lowest difficulty setting. The lowest difficulty setting is still the easiest setting to win on. The player who plays on the &#8220;Gay Minority Female&#8221; setting?&nbsp;Hardcore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although I didn&#8217;t choose it, I&#8217;m lucky enough to be playing life on the easiest difficulty setting. Still, I&#8217;m trying to use the many starting points handed to me to explore <a href="http://newlyancient.com/2012/04/25/nyuad">new</a> parts of the map where I&#8217;m not necessarily playing on the lowest difficulty setting. Hopefully, this can help me to make other difficulty settings a little less hard, with the side effect of making a pretty easy game a little more&nbsp;fun.</p>

<a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu"><img alt="NYUAD" src="http://newlyancient.com/user/files/nyuad/crest.gif" width="140"></a>
</div>
<p>This fall, I will fly halfway across the globe to attend college as a member of the third graduating class of <a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu/"><span class="caps">NYU</span> Abu Dhabi</a>. This is a choice which neither my friends nor family could have predicted, and not just because the college was only opened two years ago. Yet, here I am: choosing the road less travelled which not even I could have envisioned myself on a year ago. I&#8217;ll be turning down offers from some of the most well-know and well-established universities in the world, and not for financial reasons. Rather, I am choosing to seize the reigns of my own education and embark on an adventure across the&nbsp;globe.</p>
<h3>Culture and its&nbsp;Consequences</h3>
<p>This decision was, in fact, significantly influenced by my visit to <a href="http://dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth</a>, my other top choice. It probably represents the apotheosis of an American college education: on a beautiful New England campus,<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-202-1"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2012/04/25/nyuad#footnote-202-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> highly intelligent students talk and learn from world-class faculty. Assured of a job post-graduation by the extensive alumni network, Dartmouth students are free to enjoy their life in a Hanover bubble. <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> lacks most of these features—it has no alumni to speak of and the academic program is still taking shape—but it also lacks two things which made the difference for&nbsp;me:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Demographic gravity&nbsp;and</li>
	<li>Institutional&nbsp;inertia</li>
</ol>
<h3>Gravity <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Grounding</h3>
<p>To elaborate on my first physical fear,<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-202-2"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2012/04/25/nyuad#footnote-202-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> at Dartmouth you feel an overwhelming center of gravity. White, upper middle class Americans dominate the social atmosphere of the school, and even those who don&#8217;t come from that background feel a certain pressure to adopt its cultural norms.<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-202-3"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2012/04/25/nyuad#footnote-202-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> As a member of that demographic group, it would be all too easy to blend into the crowd, join a fraternity, maintain my current worldview, and graduate—possibly with a drinking problem. However, having attended international school for the past two years, I don&#8217;t want things to be that easy. I would miss the thrill of constantly reassessing my place in the world through the lenses of friends from dozens of&nbsp;countries.</p>
<p>Thankfully, as <span class="caps">NYU</span> president John Sexton is fond of pointing out, <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> lacks a <q>center of gravity.</q> With no central demographic to revolve around, as the school&#8217;s 450 students hail from dozens of countries, students are constantly thrown into different cultural combinations and forced to adjust their norms accordingly. This ability to rapidly recalibrate in diverse cultures is expanded by opportunities for extensive study abroad—by graduation, I could have studied in upwards of five different countries. In an increasingly globalized world, I believe the opportunities for intensive internationalism which <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> affords will become increasingly valuable, even if I might begin to lose my cultural&nbsp;center.</p>
<div class="image full">
<a href="http://newlyancient.com/user/files/nyuad/map.png"><img alt="Map of NYUAD Students" src="http://newlyancient.com/user/files/nyuad/map.png" width="620px" /></a>
<p class="caption below"><strong>Above</strong>: <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> students <a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu/news.events/student.profiles/">hail</a> from all corners of the&nbsp;globe.</p>
</div>
<h3>Inertia <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Innovation</h3>
<p>Although internationalism is certainly valuable to me, the sense of innovation at <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> is even more alluring. The centuries of history which our country&#8217;s greatest institutions point to as their strength is also their greatest weakness. With that history comes a tremendous amount of institutional inertia which makes substantive change and innovation highly challenging—just look at the difficulties Dartmouth faces in dealing with hazing. Yet, the modern era increasingly requires entrepreneurship and innovation in all sectors. As <a href="http://thedartmouth.com/2012/04/20/news/lecture">Carl Schramm</a> emphasized in a lecture I attended at Dartmouth, <q>academic institutions do not teach entrepreneurship properly or take it seriously,</q> instead emphasizing rigidity and channeling them into careers in established fields (especially Wall&nbsp;Street).</p>
<p>Of the universities which do focus on innovation, perhaps the most famous is Stanford. With its close connections to Silicon Valley, the university has a rich history of entrepreneurs emerging from its faculty and students. Thus, the curriculum and culture places a far greater emphasis on innovation than many of the great East Coast universities. While this is certainly admirable, in the process the university has perhaps lost its way as an educational institution, as a recent New Yorker <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/04/30/120430fa_fact_auletta?currentPage=all">article</a> highlights. <q>Close ties between the industry and the university</q> have become almost too close, with pragmatic innovation becoming the driving force of the university, rather than higher learning. In short, it seems that Stanford is simply allowing innovation <em>in</em>&nbsp;education.</p>
<p>In contrast, <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> is truly emphasizing innovation <em>on</em> education. The curriculum remains firmly rooted in a liberal arts <a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu/academics/catalog/core.html">core</a>, including such non-utilitarian courses as <em><a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu/academics/catalog/course.html?id=220">Becoming Human</a></em>. In concert with this liberal arts curriculum, significant educational innovations are encouraged, including pushing the power of technology while simultaneously recognizing the importance of place through study trips within the Middle East. Thus, <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> encourages innovation on the traditional liberal arts education in an interconnected&nbsp;world.</p>
<h3>Students <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Support</h3>
<p>Of course, the students are responsible for much of this innovation. Starting a school from scratch, we are pioneering in developing its culture, clubs, and credentials. While this is truly exciting, it is only made possible through the support provided by such an intimate school. <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> students are truly given the resources to succeed. Some of this comes from the substantial funding and small classes (the student–faculty ratio is 3–1), but it is also driven by the mentality of everyone associated with the school. The school&#8217;s success is entirely contingent upon the success of its students, and with only 450 students every single one can receive the individualized attention necessary to succeed. In the process of making a decision, I have been treated with genuine care by everyone associated with the university, as have my <a href="http://polymaththinktank.wordpress.com/2012/04/25/discussions-with-desert-falcons-a-deeper-look-at-nyuad/">future classmates</a>. <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> has gone out of its way to ensure that I can make a well-informed choice, even offering to help coordinate with other college visits. As an example of their dedication to students, when my flight back from an accepted student event was cancelled, an admissions officer worked with me on his Sunday night (well past midnight) to ensure I was taken care of. In short, I truly feel that my individual needs and desires will be fully respected at <span class="caps">NYUAD</span>. Or, as John Sexton would likely put it, I&#8217;ll be loved.<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-202-4"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2012/04/25/nyuad#footnote-202-4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<div class="image bigger col1">
<a href="http://newlyancient.com/user/files/nyuad/AD-moonlight.jpeg"><img alt="Skyline of Abu Dhabi" src="http://newlyancient.com/user/files/nyuad/AD-moonlight.jpeg" width="460" /></a>
<p class="caption left"><strong>Right</strong>: The skyline of my future&nbsp;<a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu/admissions/studentguide/location.html">home</a></p>
</div>
<p>So, I am ready to embark on an adventure to the Middle East. But I choose <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> not for its generous financial aid, its small classes, or its location, but for the opportunity it presents: the chance to reimagine&nbsp;education.</p>
<p class="note prompt question"><span>But before I embark on a new adventure, I must wrap up my current one, which I will be hopefully <a href="http://newlyancient.com/2012/04/10/return">reflecting</a> on a little more now that classes have concluded. So, if you want to know about living with 200 students from 70+ nationalities in New Mexico, just <a href="http://newlyancient.com/2012/04/25/nyuad#respond">ask</a>.</span></p>	</div>

		<p>People tend to write—and, thus, think—the most at the beginnings and endings of things. Whether that thing is a job, life, or education, the middle just isn’t that interesting. At the beginning, we are filled with excitement over the newness of the experience and anticipation for its possibilities. Bursting with enthusiasm, we are eager to share about our new experiences with anyone who will&nbsp;listen.</p>

<p>I’ve certainly seen this with <a href="http://parallellifeabudhabi.blogspot.com/">posts</a> <a href="http://jfsand.blogspot.com/">by</a> <a href="http://taleof3cities.tumblr.com/">students</a> at <a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu/"><span class="caps">NYU</span>-Abu Dhabi</a>. They post prolifically in the early days, but eventually their frequency deteriorates due to the inverse correlation between life and sharing. Still, as I contemplate attending college across halfway across the globe their posts help to make the prospect less&nbsp;remote.</p>

<p>Thus, I hope that by renewing my writing here and cataloguing the memories of my last <del>fifty</del>forty-four days at <a href="http://www.uwc-usa.org/default.aspx"><span class="caps">UWC</span>-<span class="caps">USA</span></a>, I might be able to offer a similar resource to students (my zero-years!) contemplating this experience which I have lived and loved for the past two&nbsp;years.</p>

<p>Of course, writing here will also help me to reconcile that I have finally reached an ending. By reflecting on this amazing breakneck experience of the past two years, I hope to gain some insight into how exactly it has impacted me and where I see myself going from here. Hopefully, this might even help me to decide where to attend&nbsp;university.</p>

<p>I thus promise to be an endblogger, posting regularly on the resolution of my life and investigating the future through pontifications on the&nbsp;past.</p>

<p>Also, please excuse the current state of the blog. I actually wrote this post several days ago, but got sidetracked with trying to restore the previous technically-advanced site. Failing that, I’m shipping my writing with this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">minimum viable product</a> until I find the time to make the blog beautiful&nbsp;again.</p>	</div>

		<blockquote><p>If you really want to know why the financial system nearly collapsed in the fall of 2008, I can tell you in one simple&nbsp;sentence&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>That sentence, paraphrased: smart people started working on Wall Street. For most of its existence, Wall Street was mundane, run by Ivy League jocks with old money. It wasn&#8217;t run by idiots, but it also wasn&#8217;t run by geniuses. Then, with the rise in college costs and Wall Street income, truly smart people started showing up—the kind of people who would otherwise be doing precedent-setting legal work or breakthrough physics research. These geniuses weren&#8217;t content with the easy wealth old Wall Street afforded—they wanted to experiment, they wanted to <em>use</em> their tremendous brainpower. And if they made boatloads of money in the process, that was just an added&nbsp;bonus.</p>
<p>The problem came when all that complicated math started collapsing under the weight of excessive greed and ignorant bosses.<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-199-1"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2009/10/14/wall-street-smarts#footnote-199-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> An already complex global financial system become a tangled web of math which eventually unraveled. Some things, particularly economic and physical infrastructures, are best run by conservatively intelligent people who won&#8217;t experiment. I don&#8217;t want a genius doing my plumbing and I don&#8217;t want one doing my&nbsp;taxes.</p>
