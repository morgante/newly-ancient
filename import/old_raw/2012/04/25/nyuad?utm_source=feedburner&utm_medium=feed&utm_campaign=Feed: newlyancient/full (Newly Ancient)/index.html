<a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu"><img alt="NYUAD" src="http://newlyancient.com/user/files/nyuad/crest.gif" width="140"></a>
</div>
<p>This fall, I will fly halfway across the globe to attend college as a member of the third graduating class of <a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu/"><span class="caps">NYU</span> Abu Dhabi</a>. This is a choice which neither my friends nor family could have predicted, and not just because the college was only opened two years ago. Yet, here I am: choosing the road less travelled which not even I could have envisioned myself on a year ago. I&#8217;ll be turning down offers from some of the most well-know and well-established universities in the world, and not for financial reasons. Rather, I am choosing to seize the reigns of my own education and embark on an adventure across the&nbsp;globe.</p>
<h3>Culture and its&nbsp;Consequences</h3>
<p>This decision was, in fact, significantly influenced by my visit to <a href="http://dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth</a>, my other top choice. It probably represents the apotheosis of an American college education: on a beautiful New England campus,<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-202-1"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2012/04/25/nyuad#footnote-202-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> highly intelligent students talk and learn from world-class faculty. Assured of a job post-graduation by the extensive alumni network, Dartmouth students are free to enjoy their life in a Hanover bubble. <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> lacks most of these features—it has no alumni to speak of and the academic program is still taking shape—but it also lacks two things which made the difference for&nbsp;me:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Demographic gravity&nbsp;and</li>
	<li>Institutional&nbsp;inertia</li>
</ol>
<h3>Gravity <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Grounding</h3>
<p>To elaborate on my first physical fear,<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-202-2"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2012/04/25/nyuad#footnote-202-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> at Dartmouth you feel an overwhelming center of gravity. White, upper middle class Americans dominate the social atmosphere of the school, and even those who don&#8217;t come from that background feel a certain pressure to adopt its cultural norms.<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-202-3"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2012/04/25/nyuad#footnote-202-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> As a member of that demographic group, it would be all too easy to blend into the crowd, join a fraternity, maintain my current worldview, and graduate—possibly with a drinking problem. However, having attended international school for the past two years, I don&#8217;t want things to be that easy. I would miss the thrill of constantly reassessing my place in the world through the lenses of friends from dozens of&nbsp;countries.</p>
<p>Thankfully, as <span class="caps">NYU</span> president John Sexton is fond of pointing out, <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> lacks a <q>center of gravity.</q> With no central demographic to revolve around, as the school&#8217;s 450 students hail from dozens of countries, students are constantly thrown into different cultural combinations and forced to adjust their norms accordingly. This ability to rapidly recalibrate in diverse cultures is expanded by opportunities for extensive study abroad—by graduation, I could have studied in upwards of five different countries. In an increasingly globalized world, I believe the opportunities for intensive internationalism which <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> affords will become increasingly valuable, even if I might begin to lose my cultural&nbsp;center.</p>
<div class="image full">
<a href="http://newlyancient.com/user/files/nyuad/map.png"><img alt="Map of NYUAD Students" src="http://newlyancient.com/user/files/nyuad/map.png" width="620px" /></a>
<p class="caption below"><strong>Above</strong>: <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> students <a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu/news.events/student.profiles/">hail</a> from all corners of the&nbsp;globe.</p>
</div>
<h3>Inertia <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Innovation</h3>
<p>Although internationalism is certainly valuable to me, the sense of innovation at <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> is even more alluring. The centuries of history which our country&#8217;s greatest institutions point to as their strength is also their greatest weakness. With that history comes a tremendous amount of institutional inertia which makes substantive change and innovation highly challenging—just look at the difficulties Dartmouth faces in dealing with hazing. Yet, the modern era increasingly requires entrepreneurship and innovation in all sectors. As <a href="http://thedartmouth.com/2012/04/20/news/lecture">Carl Schramm</a> emphasized in a lecture I attended at Dartmouth, <q>academic institutions do not teach entrepreneurship properly or take it seriously,</q> instead emphasizing rigidity and channeling them into careers in established fields (especially Wall&nbsp;Street).</p>
<p>Of the universities which do focus on innovation, perhaps the most famous is Stanford. With its close connections to Silicon Valley, the university has a rich history of entrepreneurs emerging from its faculty and students. Thus, the curriculum and culture places a far greater emphasis on innovation than many of the great East Coast universities. While this is certainly admirable, in the process the university has perhaps lost its way as an educational institution, as a recent New Yorker <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/04/30/120430fa_fact_auletta?currentPage=all">article</a> highlights. <q>Close ties between the industry and the university</q> have become almost too close, with pragmatic innovation becoming the driving force of the university, rather than higher learning. In short, it seems that Stanford is simply allowing innovation <em>in</em>&nbsp;education.</p>
<p>In contrast, <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> is truly emphasizing innovation <em>on</em> education. The curriculum remains firmly rooted in a liberal arts <a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu/academics/catalog/core.html">core</a>, including such non-utilitarian courses as <em><a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu/academics/catalog/course.html?id=220">Becoming Human</a></em>. In concert with this liberal arts curriculum, significant educational innovations are encouraged, including pushing the power of technology while simultaneously recognizing the importance of place through study trips within the Middle East. Thus, <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> encourages innovation on the traditional liberal arts education in an interconnected&nbsp;world.</p>
<h3>Students <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Support</h3>
<p>Of course, the students are responsible for much of this innovation. Starting a school from scratch, we are pioneering in developing its culture, clubs, and credentials. While this is truly exciting, it is only made possible through the support provided by such an intimate school. <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> students are truly given the resources to succeed. Some of this comes from the substantial funding and small classes (the student–faculty ratio is 3–1), but it is also driven by the mentality of everyone associated with the school. The school&#8217;s success is entirely contingent upon the success of its students, and with only 450 students every single one can receive the individualized attention necessary to succeed. In the process of making a decision, I have been treated with genuine care by everyone associated with the university, as have my <a href="http://polymaththinktank.wordpress.com/2012/04/25/discussions-with-desert-falcons-a-deeper-look-at-nyuad/">future classmates</a>. <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> has gone out of its way to ensure that I can make a well-informed choice, even offering to help coordinate with other college visits. As an example of their dedication to students, when my flight back from an accepted student event was cancelled, an admissions officer worked with me on his Sunday night (well past midnight) to ensure I was taken care of. In short, I truly feel that my individual needs and desires will be fully respected at <span class="caps">NYUAD</span>. Or, as John Sexton would likely put it, I&#8217;ll be loved.<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-202-4"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2012/04/25/nyuad#footnote-202-4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p class="caption left"><strong>Right</strong>: The skyline of my future&nbsp;<a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu/admissions/studentguide/location.html">home</a></p>
</div>
<p>So, I am ready to embark on an adventure to the Middle East. But I choose <span class="caps">NYUAD</span> not for its generous financial aid, its small classes, or its location, but for the opportunity it presents: the chance to reimagine&nbsp;education.</p>
<p class="note prompt question"><span>But before I embark on a new adventure, I must wrap up my current one, which I will be hopefully <a href="http://newlyancient.com/2012/04/10/return">reflecting</a> on a little more now that classes have concluded. So, if you want to know about living with 200 students from 70+ nationalities in New Mexico, just <a href="http://newlyancient.com/2012/04/25/nyuad#respond">ask</a>.</span></p>					</div>
