<p>Although over the past two years of my studies I&#x2019;ve been drawn toward more <em>human</em> fields (primarily economics), I continue to love coding. Indeed, the times I spend coding are some of the best moments I have, partially because time disappears. While I&#x2019;ve enjoyed dabbling in other areas, coding up <em>something</em> is still my favorite way to spend a&#xA0;night.</p>
<p>All this merely serves as an explanation of why I spent several hours converting the theme for this site into one anybody can use. It&#x2019;s a fairly-customizable theme for <a href="http://habariproject.org">Habari</a> which I designed to take advantage of the innovations on that platform, particularly modules and&#xA0;areas.</p>
<p>So, if you&#x2019;re interested in imitating the design of this site, just head on over to the <a href="http://lab.morgante.net/shield">project page</a> and download <strong>Shield</strong>. Though I doubt many people will end up using this (if only because of Habari&#x2019;s minuscule reach), it&#x2019;s been fun to develop and will also give me an incentive to start designing a new theme for this site (after all, I can&#x2019;t have <em>too</em> many&#xA0;imitators).</p>
<p>Also, I must say I&#x2019;m quite proud of my <a href="http://lab.morgante.net/">project lab</a>. As it serves as the home for numerous projects (primarily Habari bookmarks and plugins), constantly updating it would take too much work. Thus, I have developed a system on top of Habari which pulls in all the data, including releases and help information, from <a href="http://github.com/morgante">GitHub</a>. If you want something similar, check out the <a href="http://lab.morgante.net/mpango">plugin</a> and <a href="http://lab.morgante.net/scientist">theme</a> which power&#xA0;it.</p>
<p class="note"><span>So, check out my <a href="http://lab.morgante.net/shield">theme</a>. I promise more substantive posts will be coming soon (I have a ton queued up in <a href="http://lab.morgante.net/simplynoted">Simplenote</a>).</span></p>
