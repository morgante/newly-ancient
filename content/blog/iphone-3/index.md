<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/softwareupdate/">iPhone <span class="caps">OS</span> 3.0</a> has been released and I&#x2019;ve had the opportunity to play with it. All in all, it is a very welcome improvement, with numerous enhancements and improvements. <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/business/1626396,ihnatko-review-iphone-os-3-061709.article">Quite</a> <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/141187/2009/06/iphone_3.html?lsrc=twt_macworld">a</a> <a href="http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/instant-expert-secrets-features-of-iphone-os-30/P0">few</a> <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/business/1626396,ihnatko-review-iphone-os-3-061709.article">guides</a> have been published enumerating these additions, so I&#x2019;ll keep this brief. Among the many new features, I found the following seven to be particularly&#xA0;helpful.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Spotlight</strong>. While being able to access everything in a couple of keystrokes is extremely useful, the real benefit is in the iPod app. I often have a particular song on my mind, and I can now call it up within seconds. For apps, it&#x2019;s still easier to swish between screens: typing on the iPhone still isn&#x2019;t&#xA0;<em>efficient</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Notes Syncing</strong>. The previous lack of Notes syncing forced me towards Evernote. With syncing now supported, it&#x2019;s more of a toss-up: Notes is easier and more efficient, but <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> is more&#xA0;powerful.</li>
  <li><strong>Widescreen Keyboard</strong>. The widescreen keyboard which previously was only available in Safari has been extended to Mail and Notes, making typing a quick email a&#xA0;breeze.</li>
  <li><strong>Undo</strong>. Shake to undo. Simple and&#xA0;intuitive.</li>
  <li><strong>Stocks</strong>. There is now a landscape view featuring a large graph, which can be clicked to view historical prices. Stocks also have more information available, including market statistics and news. It&#x2019;s still far too cumbersome to quickly look up a&#xA0;stock.</li>
  <li><strong>AutoFill</strong>. Safari now automatically saves form and login information, nullifying the need to mess around with&#xA0;<a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">1Password</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Calendar</strong>. Though iPhone <span class="caps">OS</span> 3.0 includes support for CalDAV, it unfortunately doesn&#x2019;t support delegated calendars, making it relatively useless for my dozen calendars. Thankfully, Google has <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google+Mobile/thread?tid=3c09b67191a462d9&amp;hl=en">updated</a> their Exchange-based sync <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/apple/sync.html">tool</a> to support up to 25&#xA0;calendars.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the low price of free, it&#x2019;s a no-brainer for existing iPhone owners to upgrade. For iPod Touch users, the added features merit the $9.95 upgrade&#xA0;price.</p>
