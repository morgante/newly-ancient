<p>Two thousand nine promises to be a good year for me. I have many plans for this year, but, first, a little&#xA0;history.</p>
<p>Two thousand eight could be described in many ways, but ultimately it was characterized by a feeling of <em>slowness</em>. I enjoyed the relaxation and deep thought that this slowness brought the time for. For the most part, I don&#x2019;t have much to show you (yet!) from 2008; but the quiet reflection of this past year gave me opportunity to develop new ideas and&#xA0;views.</p>
<p>Among the highlights of the year, these stand&#xA0;out:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In July, I abandoned my older <a href="http://myfla.ws/blog/2008/07/19/goodbye-and-good-luck/">blog</a>, which I subsequently revived at its present location in&#xA0;<a href="http://newlyancient.com/2008/11/02/hello-world">November</a>.</li>
  <li>My summer internship at <a href="http://globalclassroom.us/">GlobalClassroom</a> was in my first &#x201C;real&#x201D; work experience, and a good one at&#xA0;that.</li>
  <li>Continuing upon this work trend, I was able to expand my <a href="http://mastermade.us" title="MasterMade">business</a> in new&#xA0;directions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these accomplishments, I am left with the feeling that I didn&#x2019;t really do much in 2008. However, the slow thinking of the year has left me with some exciting ideas which I plan to implement in&#xA0;2009.</p>
<p>If 2008 was characterized by intellectual laziness, 2009 will center on intellectual vigor. Much about the new year brings me hope, a hope upon which I plan to act. In all aspects of my life, I resolve to implemented this new&#xA0;vigor:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I will vigorously blog more, since my thoughts don&#x2019;t help if nobody hears them.<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-155-1"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2009/01/03/2009#footnote-155-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>I will vigorously pursue new work projects. I am extremely excited by <em>Project X</em>, but I want it to get moving&#xA0;faster.</li>
  <li>I will work to vigorously improve <a href="http://students2oh.org/">Students 2.0</a> in my new role as&#xA0;publisher.</li>
  <li>On a personal note, I&#x2019;m working to vigorously exercise more. If I die at 30, my ideas won&#x2019;t live on&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;and that&#x2019;d be a shame, wouldn&#x2019;t&#xA0;it?</li>
  <li>Similarly, I will vigorously throw myself into reading, particularly of a &#x201C;print&#x201D; variety. There are books from last Christmas which I still haven&#x2019;t read, and I&#x2019;d also like to spend some more time with &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; magazines.<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-155-2"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2009/01/03/2009#footnote-155-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>With those concrete resolutions set down on the stones of the interweb, I also would like to make 2009 a continuation of my media exploration. Over time, I work to <del>master</del> learn about specific mediums. Though I consider myself a decent writer, I would like to make the first half of 2009 revolve around improving my relationship with the written word, especially in terms of <em>speed</em> and editing. If the finity<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-155-3"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2009/01/03/2009#footnote-155-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> of time allows, I will also move into the spoken word in multiple incarnations: debate, speech, and&#xA0;podcasting.</p>
<p>In short, I have grand hopes for 2009, both personally and globally. In many ways, I hope 2009 will finally shake off the stupor of the past year<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-155-4"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2009/01/03/2009#footnote-155-4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> in favor of direct&#xA0;action.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m ready,&#xA0;2009.</p>
