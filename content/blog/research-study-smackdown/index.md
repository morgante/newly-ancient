<p>If you are to believe Patricia Greenfield, the internet and technology are producing a decline in critical thinking. In a recent study summarized by <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090128092341.htm">ScienceDaily</a>, she argues that technology has led to a decline in analysis and critical thinking. Yet the study has numerous holes in it, all stemming from an almost pathetic ignorance of what reading and critical thinking actually mean. <a href="http://education.change.org/blog/view/snark_attack_ucla_research_dissing_technology_bombs">Clay Burell</a> has done an excellent smackdown of the article, showing how nothing in it actually serves as a good argument against technology. The whole post is well worth a read, but here is a summary of the main flaws in the&#xA0;study:</p>
<p>The study purports that reading for pleasure has declined, but isn&#x2019;t willing to recognize online reading as reading. This flies in the face of the fact that me reading the article and you <em>reading</em> this post is reading&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;for&#xA0;<em>pleasure</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>How much should schools use new media, versus older techniques such as reading and classroom&#xA0;discussion?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently, new media doesn&#x2019;t include reading or discussion. Well, you know what you&#x2019;re doing now? Reading. And see that thread below, with the box to reply? It&#x2019;s a&#xA0;discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Schools should make more effort to test students using visual media, she said, by asking them to prepare PowerPoint presentations, for&#xA0;example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, what we really need are more PowerPoints, covered in glittery fonts and distracting animations, and delivered by emotionless speakers. Before anyone touches a computer to give a presentation, they should take a course in Public Speaking&#xA0;101.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>However, most visual media are real-time media that do not allow time for reflection, analysis or imagination&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;those do not get developed by real-time media such as television or video games. Technology is not a panacea in education, because of the skills that are being&#xA0;lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement continues a thread of misunderstanding of technology throughout the article. For one thing, much of the web and technology still <strong>is</strong> text-based and asynchronous. But even the visual components can easily be given time to reflect. Every YouTube video has a pause button. Oh, and as for <span class="caps">TV</span>: there are these new things called TiVos. Ever heard of&#xA0;them?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="dquo">&#x201C;</span>Wiring classrooms for Internet access does not enhance learning,&#x201D; Greenfield&#xA0;said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are dozens of studies showing that internet access does enhance learning, as opposed to this single, poorly-researched study.<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-162-1"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2009/01/30/research-study-smackdown#footnote-162-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Sadly, many in both the media and educational establishment will continue to cite this study as they attempt to lambaste and oppose technology. If you do encounter an oppositional Luddite attempting to obstruct technology based upon this study, just point them at Clay&#x2019;s excellent <a href="http://education.change.org/blog/view/snark_attack_ucla_research_dissing_technology_bombs">rebuttal</a>. Maybe the only thing that we can be sure of is that technology is making it harder to control people and students, so many have a vested interesting in obstructing&#xA0;it.</p>
<p>Finally, for some laughs, think about it like this: what if someone had done a study like this at the dawn of the book? If they counted reading scrolls as the only form of reading, then surely there would be a massive decline in reading for pleasure. The satirical video which Clay <a href="http://education.change.org/blog/view/lol_video_satire_medieval_help-desk_or_why_books_shouldnt_replace_scrolls">linked to</a> makes that point&#xA0;hilariously:</p>

<p>On a personal note, I&#x2019;ve been getting over a bad cold which has made it hard to think and write. I have a long list of ideas, which I will begin following up on&#xA0;tomorrow.</p>
