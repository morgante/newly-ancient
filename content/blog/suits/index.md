<p>You can&#x2019;t change the world if you ignore&#xA0;it.</p>
<p>Among the progressive base, there seems to be this idea that corporations and society are inherently bad. This attitude, which leads to growing isolation, doesn&#x2019;t help to advance progressive causes. Instead, it just stigmatizes good ideas as dangerously&#xA0;radical.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: this world isn&#x2019;t perfect. Society, at all levels, is rampart with corruption, greed, and other &#x201C;sins.&#x201D;<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-161-2"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2009/01/25/suits#footnote-161-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Unfortunately, the typical progressive/radical response to this is to simply abandon society. But in reality, substantive change only comes from the inside. We can&#x2019;t all be Thoreau. To change society, you have to be part of&#xA0;it.</p>
<p>In a plethora of situations, I run into the conflict between ideals and practicality. It is better to build a good compromise than to ride the high horse into the sunset. Though some call it Machiavellian, I call it pragmatic. Everything should be analyzed as a cost vs. value equation. What is the <em>cost</em> to my moral integrity? What is the <em>benefit</em> to&#xA0;society?</p>
<p>The world isn&#x2019;t painted in black and white, but in shades of grey. Nothing is inherently evil and nothing is inherently bad. Corporations are just a collection of people, and <em>all</em> people are just trying to do what they think is&#xA0;best.</p>
<p>I run into this conflict all the time, both in work and school. Sure, I don&#x2019;t believe there is any point to an assignment. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean I won&#x2019;t do it: in the end, it&#x2019;s better for me to ace a pointless class than to fail it. It&#x2019;s better to accept that job at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother">Goliath National Bank</a> than to barely make ends meet&#xA0;elsewhere.</p>
<p>Society doesn&#x2019;t give a damn about you unless you give a damn about&#xA0;it.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s fun to wear band shirts, but eventually we have to &#x201C;suit up.&#x201D;<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-161-3"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2009/01/25/suits#footnote-161-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
