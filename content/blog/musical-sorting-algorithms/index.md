<p>Sorting algorithms (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">Quicksort</a>) are frequently represented visually, but they can also be represented musically. Through guitars and drums, a <span class="caps">UCLA</span> grad student has created auditory <a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~rcompton/musical_sorting_algorithms/musical_sorting_algorithms.html">demonstrations</a> of sorting algorithms. Showing what sorting algorithms sound like would be an excellent opener for a lesson. These demonstrations connect an abstract concept to something we can hear, making it far easier to&#xA0;grasp.</p>
