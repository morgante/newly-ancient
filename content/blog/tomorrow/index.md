<p>Forty-five years ago, a great bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_a_Dream">history</a> was made. Eight years ago, we saw a different sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">history</a>. That history didn&#x2019;t turn out so&#xA0;well.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, history will be made. The only question left is what sort of history it will&#xA0;be.</p>
<p>Today, I didn&#x2019;t have school. School was closed in honor of a great moment in history, and the man who inspired&#xA0;it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, history will be made. While it is made, I will be taking my math exam. I will be able to tell my grandchildren about quadratic&#xA0;formulas.</p>
