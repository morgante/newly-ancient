<p>George Orwell posited that thought could be controlled and manipulated through the language we speak (in his case, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak">Newspeak</a>). Many other philosophers and scientists have pondered this question, while most politicians simply accept it as fact and use it to their advantage. However, there has been a disturbing lack of empirical evidence for this phenomena. A psychologist at Stanford has conducted a <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/205985">study</a> showing that the gender of nouns in a language influence our perceptions of that noun. The French, who use the masculine <em>pont</em> for bridges, generally highlight their elements of power and strength, while Germans (who use the feminine <em>Br&#xFC;cke</em>) describe bridges as elegant and airy. You can see the bridge for yourself at <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102518565"><span class="caps">NPR</span></a> and see which set of adjectives matches your perceptions. Does this make English more neutral and accurate, since it largely lacks&#xA0;gender?</p>
