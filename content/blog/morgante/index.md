<p class="note warning"><span>What follows is a poorly written exposition of my recent activity. If you&#x2019;re not in the mood for self-congratulatory bullshit, here&#x2019;s the gist: I made <a href="http://morgante.net">morgante.net</a>. It&#x2019;s cool. It&#x2019;s&#xA0;me.</span></p>
<p>I made myself last month. Rather, I made the online version of myself: <a href="http://morgante.net">morgante.net</a>. I&#x2019;d been meaning to do this for months, but <a href="http://www.sitesprint.info/">#sitesprint</a> finally gave me the motivation to do&#xA0;so.</p>
<p>Before doing so, I created numerous designs, from the gaudy to the overly-subdued. One was entirely primary colors, another was pure black-and-white. With respect to the design, I feel I&#x2019;ve reached the ideal equilibrium with respect to the Goldilocks Principle: interesting, but not&#xA0;garish.</p>
<p>As my online home on the web, it of course links to all my profiles on various sites (I have too many). Most notably, I&#x2019;ve added a link to <a href="http://lab.morgante.net/">Lemnos</a>, my lab. Its name comes from the island upon which the great engineer-god <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a> wrought his creations. Within the lab are all my various technical projects. Its powered by <a href="http://habariproject.org/en/">Habari</a> and a <a href="http://lab.morgante.net/mpango">plugin</a> of my own devising. The project pages are almost entirely automated: metadata is extracted from the plugin source, downloads are built from the subversion repository, and support is powered by the <a href="https://habariproject.org/forums/">Habari Forums</a>. Overall, I&#x2019;m quite satisfied with the&#xA0;result.</p>
<p>Back on my <a href="http://morgante.net/">hub</a>, I did my best to keep things jovial. Building a website entirely devoted to myself is inherently rather pompous, so I was sure to have a healthy dose of self-mockery. The <a href="http://morgante.net/about">about page</a> is a tongue-in-cheek tale of my life, while the <a href="http://twitter.com/morgantepell">Twitter</a> widget in the sidebar features my occasionally whimsical wordplay. Meanwhile, the <a href="http://morgante.net/contact">contact page</a> is fully AJAXified, using my <a href="http://lab.morgante.net/aliencontact">AlienContact</a>&#xA0;plugin.</p>
<p>In the future, I plan to have a fully integrated lifesteam, &#xE0; la <a href="http://www.sweetcron.com/">Sweetcron</a>. It will have all my activity from various places around the web, in addition to random life achievement bits: school awards, projects I start, etc.&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;the idea is that I will be able to programmatically generate a resume from the data. Though I currently have something similar <a href="http://newlyancient.com/stream">here</a>, I would like to eliminate a lot of the superfluous material from <a href="http://newlyancient.com">Newy Ancient</a> and move it to my hub. The next iteration of my blog will put my best content up front, while also integrating newer (short) link&#xA0;posts.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more exciting things as I finally get some priorities straightened out. My goal is to write at least one article a week, when the hellish load of <span class="caps">AP</span> English allows&#xA0;it.</p>
