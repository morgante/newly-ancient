<p>I am a producer. I like to produce things, whether that means businesses, websites, or&#xA0;blogs.</p>
<p>For the most part, education fails to thoughtfully educate producers. Over the centuries, schools have gotten very good at teaching consumers. We emphasize reading and math, so consumers can consume&#xA0;more.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with this. Many people <em>are</em> consumers, and everyone needs the skills to be one. However, a growing tide of people are producers&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;people who feel the unquenchable need to <em>make</em>. The education system fails to even recognize this trend, let alone teach to&#xA0;it.</p>
<p>From a purely business perspective, this is dangerous. Producers are responsible for a disproportionate percentage of the <span class="caps">GDP</span>, and giving producers better education will help to increase that. But it&#x2019;s also important from a human perspective&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;education should match the personality of the&#xA0;student.</p>
<p>A good start would be to help students identify whether they are a producer or consumer. This is as easy as asking a simple&#xA0;<a href="http://www.softwarebyrob.com/2008/05/18/the-single-most-important-career-question-you-can-ask-yourself/">question</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Some people are consumers by nature; they consume vast quantities of knowledge purely for learning&#x2019;s sake. Others are producers; they consume knowledge with the intent of one day acting on the knowledge and producing something, be it a book, a song, a blog, a startup, etc&#x2026; Neither is better than the&#xA0;other.</p>
  <p>The key is to answer one question: <strong>which are&#xA0;you?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond that, schools can give education appropriate to each type of student. For the most part, we are a mix of both producers and consumers; teaching consumption and production will help&#xA0;everyone.</p>
<p>The one additional component which producers absolutely need more of in their education is <em>practice</em>. Whenever possible, there should be time to practice (authentically) producing businesses, books, or music. Though practice doesn&#x2019;t make you perfect, it does make you a whole lot better of a&#xA0;producer.</p>
<p>Schools need to recognize and identify producers, so a proper education can be given to&#xA0;them.</p>
<p>How do <em>you</em> teach&#xA0;producers?</p>
