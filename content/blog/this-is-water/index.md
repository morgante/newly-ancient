<p>Listening to <a href="http://vimeo.com/65576562">this speech</a> by David Forster Wallace taught (maybe, reminded) me why I&#x2019;m here and pulled me out of a slump.<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-227-1"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2013/05/12/this-is-water#footnote-227-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> While the <a href="http://vimeo.com/65576562">video</a> is great, I recommend reading <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213082423/http://www.marginalia.org/dfw_kenyon_commencement.html">the full speech</a> (paired with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B6E0mijV5A">this song</a>) to get the full&#xA0;impact.</p>
<blockquote>It is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over: &#x201C;This is water.&#x201D;</blockquote>
