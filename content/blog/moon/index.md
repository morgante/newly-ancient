<p>The crucial flaw of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCLB"><span class="caps">NCLB</span></a>, in my opinion, is that is fails to inspire. The law has many other faults, of course, including its lack of funding and regimented focus on testing. However, the root problem is that <span class="caps">NCLB</span> is attempting to use an evolutionary methodology for a truly revolutionary goal &#x2013; almost total proficiency. There is no easily articulated goal which all citizens can rally around: the standards are convoluted and the metrics for success are continually redefined in contradiction with themselves. <a href="http://borderland.northernattitude.org/">Doug Noon</a> perfectly <a href="http://borderland.northernattitude.org/2008/11/13/assessments-for-learning/">captures</a> this, in the context of Kennedy&#x2019;s space program:<sup class="footnote-link" id="footnote-link-151-1"><a href="http://newlyancient.com/2008/11/20/moon#footnote-151-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>If we&#x2019;d have used an <span class="caps">NCLB</span>-style approach to the Apollo moon mission, President Kennedy would have simply ordered <span class="caps">NASA</span> to fly conventional airplanes higher and higher until they fell out of the sky, and then blamed the pilots for lacking the will and the know-how to get the job done.</blockquote>
<p>How can we reach for the moon with&#xA0;education?</p>
