<p>Regarding Twitter, Chuck Soda <a href="http://chuckskoda.com/entry/twitter-clients-farewell/">makes</a> a (more succinctly) similar point to <a href="http://newlyancient.com/2012/08/20/twitter-me">mine</a> about Twitter consolidating rather than&#xA0;innovating:</p>
<blockquote>They should have a vision for what the future of communicating and sharing looks like, and be building it. But from the looks of it, they aren&#x2019;t. They&#x2019;re just trying to protect what they&#x2019;ve already built. That&#x2019;s always a losing position&#x2026; Always.</blockquote>
